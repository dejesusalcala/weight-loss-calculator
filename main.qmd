# Introduction

In this project we be creating a calorie calculator to aid us in achieving our weight loss/gain goals

# Basal Metabolic Rate

Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:
For men:
BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A + 5
For women:
BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A - 161

```{r}
ComputeBMR = function(weight = 150, height = 65, age = 32, gender = "male") {
  
  # Convert from imperial to metric
  
  weight = weight*0.45359237
  height = height*2.54
    
  if (gender == "male") {
    bmr = 10*weight + 6.25*height - 5*age + 5
  } else if (gender == "female") {
    bmr = 10*weight + 6.25*height - 5*age - 161
  }
  
  return(bmr)
}
```

```{r}
my_bmr = ComputeBMR(weight = 141, height = 65, age = 32, gender = "male")
my_bmr
```

```{r}
my_bmr + my_bmr*.9
```


```{r}
140*0.45359237
```
